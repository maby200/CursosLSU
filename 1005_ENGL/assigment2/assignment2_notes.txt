The sentence has two components: subject and predicate. The subject answers to the question "who or what is the sentence about?", Whereas the predicate, the question "What assertion does the sentence make about the subject?"

There are four patterns in sentences:
1. Subject + verb + optional adverb modifyers
	In this pattern the verb is intransitive, which means that the verb is not transfering any action from a doer to a receiver.
2. S + v + object direct
	In this pattern the object direct can be spotted with subject + verb + what / whom
3. s + v + subject complement
	This is the pattern where the verbs are "linking verbs" and are followed by subject complements which can be identified replacing the verb with an equal sign.
4. s + v + object complement
whereas the subject complement describes subject of the sentence, object complement describes the direct object.
5. S + v + IDO + DO
If DO can be spotted with What? or Who?, the IDO can be found with To what or whom?
