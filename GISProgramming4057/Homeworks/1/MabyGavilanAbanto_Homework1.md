# Developing homework 1

1. Use the these two tutorials as reference: [Work with Anaconda](../Tutorials/Work_with_Anaconda.md) and [Work with Jupyter Notebook](../Tutorials/Work_with_Jupyter_Notebook.md)
2. Install Anaconda on your work/home computer
3. Create a new environment using Anaconda with the name of "geog4057" and python 3.9 (remember to activate if you want to install packages)
4. Install jupyter notebook using pip or conda 
5. Register the anaconda environment "geog4057" with the ipykernel module
	
6. Run jupyter notebook from the anaconda prompt 
    
   #### Items from 1 to 6 are displayed here.
    (Instead of running Jupyter notebook I decided to Jupyter Lab run since it is similar to the notebook).
