The houses are under sea level. 

"It's just dumb luck that the breach occurred on the left side and not on the right side and there was some minor flooding over here but nothing but for these houses but nothing like what happened hammerton geographical difference made of all the difference in the world and how bad your house got hammered in Hurricane Katrina"

Orleans parish & Jefferson parish. houses in Orleans parish was affected the more.

"I walls": Type of wall built in the past as levees for avoiding flooding in NOLA . 

There is a part of the levees that is dark and there is where the breach occured. 

Be careful this is an automated transcription from voice recording:
okay or at least it wasn't eyewall now 88 that goes down your below the surface by up to 20 30 feet and then they build this concrete structure around it to basically help stabilize so with an eye wall so just think about what up on either side and that's what serving as your blood protection you put water you fill water up on one side of this thing and it's very it's a lot of pressure on to that wall and eventually it just mashed this thing over that's what happened you look down here again so the left glasses right there it's about 2/3 of the way up the side of that floodwall s? And went all the way around the top of this canal and it flow into Jefferson Parish but the flooding wasn't nearly what it was in in Orleans to understand oK Google so prick in the Levee on London Avenue there's a leak on the Orleans Avenue Canal due to a 40 design and water is coming in off the industrial canaliers sea level the storm 

Maby:
Water rises up to 9 ft (2.5~3 ft above sea level) to reach equilibrium. It has to pass 2 days to reach that equilibrium. 

3rd stop: NOLA stop 
In this place the water entered below the I wall due to the sand that the soil contained.

Maby:
houses were affected by the flow of the water below the sand soil. Everything was buried, cars, houses. There is a newspaper with the news that Katrina was approaching at that time.

4th stop Lake Pontchatrain
The waters goes to the gulf of mexico. There are like 5 rivers flowing to the lake and it makes it look like it has more elevation. 

Maby: 
more than 30 years ago shell dredging was intensively done in the lake for landfill, roadbeds, etc. That put a lot of suspended sediments that almost killed the ecology in the lake. It is been recoverying since then.
Uniformly 14, 15 ft deep. In the connection between the lake and missisipi river it has 40ft deep.

The wealthiest part of NOLA is in that lake. 3ft above sea level. It was artificially built. The city has a slope to conduce all the storm runoff to the lake. This means that they have the enough money to do engineering and not be affected but what happens with the other parts of the city? Why not helping them to manage storm runnof or any surface flow to avoid human and propertie loss?

5th stop : Misissipi river
The purpose of the Bonne Carre is to divert water to aliviate flooding preasure to the city.
the creation of land helps to buffer the propagation of the flooding
About the river distributary that goes to the gulf of mexico: There are pollutants that come from the north with the misissipi river, for example the agricultural runoff. And they are spread all over the land, affecting the ecology.

6th stop: Battlefield National Park
This place is important because here the US soldiers confronted the UK soldiers. The US defense succeed in this battle. After that, a man inherited the lands and he bought many slaves to  live in that place, but in 1966 the US government reclaimed this land due to historical importance and the people living there was moved to other part of NOLA.

7th stop: St. Vincent de Paul Cemetery
This cemetery has a mausoleum architectonic design. There are a big amount of statues. The bodies are not brueid below land but over it and inside concrete.

8th stop: Different architectural House and former missisipi port
