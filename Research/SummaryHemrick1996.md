si bien semiaridos es el clima donde hay mayor emisión de sedimentos, esto no es una constante y que no se puede tomar como un patrón consistente  (Walling & Webb,1983)

1ra correlacion: geologycal features and sed yield
2nd: sediment yield per unit drainage area, or specific sediment yield, and drainage
area.

The influence of human activity sometimes dwarfs the effects of the physiographical variable

After the mid-1970s government-sponsored sediment data collection declined signifi
cantly, and a centralized compilation of surveys since 1975 is not yet available.

Major land resource areas (MLRAs) are the first level of generalization of these data. MLRAs are regions
that have distinctive soil, climate, water resource, and land use characteristics (USDA,
1981). 181 MLRAs, averaging 43 000 km2 in area. 133 are represented by reservoirs in the sedimentation data set. These MLRAs are further grouped into 20 Land Resource Regions (LRRs) which are roughly similar to physiographic regions. MLRAs and LRRs differ from previous physiographic maps in that land use is a major factor in defining regions

Results

Specific sediment yield is highest in the agricultural regions of the humid
eastern and central states, and in the Coast Ranges of California. Moderate sediment
yields occur in the western Great Plains, the semiarid western states, and in the
Appalachians. Low values occur in forested areas of the northeast and northwest, and
in the northern Great Plains. With the exception of the Coast Ranges, neither the areas
of highest relief (the Rocky Mountains and the Cascades/Sierras) nor the areas of emiarid climate (intermontane basins and western Great Plains) have especially high
average sediment yields
