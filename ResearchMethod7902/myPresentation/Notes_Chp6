E.R can be surveys interviews tests. It can request many different type of beliefs such as behaviors, knowledge opinions attitudes, expectations...

explicit reports are measures of beliefs people have about themselves, others, places events, activities or objects.

explicitness. People know they are providing information to a researcher when they
are surveyed,

cannot be right or wrnog because are personal opiniions or preferences. And thus, cannot be compared to any objective standard.

ACTIVITY DIARY the term diary should  not be confused with th everyday. These diaries are confidential records or persona letters that people write to themselves to record their experiences, feelings.

Survey, interveiw or test is called INSTURMENT. The specific question/satement is ITEM.

in closed-ended items the interviewee is forced to choose an answer and sometimes this answer is not spontaneous, thus not reflecting the interviewee's thoughts

Format of Explcit rpeorts:
> Rating scale - diving a little deeper
- Generic rating scale ->
	any rating scale that doenst have specific formats of one of the following types.
- Semantic differential -> rate a set of entities (object, place, event) based on connotative meaning (not what it litterally means but what it suggests)
- Likert Scales -> Respondents express their deree of agreement/disagreement.
- Paired comparison ratings -> compare entities. ORdinal: which two of three neighborhoods are most similar? Metric:What is the distance from the uni to the downtown?

CONSTRAINT ABOUT CLOSED ENDED items
Patterns of responses are produced sometimes. And it suggest the respondent was not answering sincerely. These are RESPONSE SETS.

One can spot them by finding a set of answers just "too good to be true" or consistent responding. Social desirability is the term that refers to the tndency for respondents to give this kind of answers.

Question 1:
What are the primary purposes of conducting a census, and how has the methodology evolved over time?

Answer: The primary purposes of conducting a census include gathering demographic data for political representation, resource allocation, and policy-making. Historically, the U.S. Census was conducted as a complete enumeration of the population, with all questions asked of all individuals from 1790 to 1930. However, due to the growing population and logistical challenges, the methodology evolved in 1940 to include a short form (basic demographic data) administered to the entire population and a long form (detailed data) given to a fraction of the population. The introduction of the American Community Survey (ACS) in 1996 further enhanced data collection by providing continuous demographic information, allowing for more timely insights into population changes , .

Question 2:
What are some of the challenges associated with census data collection, and how do they impact the accuracy of the data?

Answer: Challenges associated with census data collection include nonresponse bias, where certain populations, such as the homeless and low-income individuals, are often undercounted. This undercounting can lead to inaccuracies in demographic representation and affect resource allocation and political representation. Additionally, privacy concerns restrict access to individual responses for 70 years, which can limit the availability of detailed data for research purposes. The Census Bureau employs various strategies, such as using non-response enumerators to encourage participation, but these challenges highlight the complexities involved in achieving a complete and accurate census , .
